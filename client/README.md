## File Structure
1. `src\assets` - This is where you place images (.png, .svg, etc...)
2. `src\components` - Common components to be used throughout the application, you usually don't wanna touch this folder
3. `src\pages` - Pages of the website
4. `src\constants` - Global variables  
5. `src\modules\*` - Where each group will be doing the most work in. Contains files related to your module
```
Example for #5:
src
|__modules
        |__borrowing
                    |__ index.tsx - Entry point for the borrowing module
                    |__ Search.tsx - Contains the search page for the moduule
```

## Branching
1. When you clone the repository, make sure you are in the `main` branch. You can check by running this command:
```
git status
```
Expected output would be:
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
2. Pull the latest changes
```
git pull
```
3. Switch to the branch your module is assigned to. Example:
```
git checkout -b {branch name of your module}
// G1 example:
// Refer to the bottom for the list of all branch names
git checkout -b g1-borrowing-module
```
4. Pull the latest changes again, this time from your module

```
git pull
```
5. To push your local changes, run the following commands: 
```
git add {files you want to stage}
// or if you want to stage everything
git add . 

git commit -m [{type of change}] {meaningful message}
// Added table example:
git commit -m "[feature] added a meaningful table 😲"  

git push
// For merge conflicts, resolve within your subgroups 
```
